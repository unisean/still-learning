Ryan comes over to my house with a unicycle in hand, and shouts "Sean! Teach me how to ride this!" I've never ridden a unicycle before, but I decide to try. Holding a bookcase for balance, I put one foot on the pedal, lean forward, and crush my testicles with the seat. I fall to the ground. Ryan just laughs at me, and walks away. 24 hours later, I was able to ride a unicycle like a pro.
